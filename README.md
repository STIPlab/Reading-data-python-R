## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- VS Code with Jupyter extension
- Required Python packages (see Installation section)

### Installation

#### Method 1: Direct Download/Copy Files

1. **Get the Files**
   - Click "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP" on this repository page to download the ZIP file
   - Or copy and save individual files (`Story_intro.ipynb`, `data.md`, etc.) as needed

2. **Run in VS Code (Recommended)**
   - Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the "Jupyter" extension
   - Open the downloaded folder in VS Code
   - Open `Story_intro.ipynb`
   - Run all cells

#### Method 3: Run R Code

For users who prefer R over Python:

1. **Install R and RStudio**
   - Install R from https://www.r-project.org/
   - Install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

2. **Run the R Script**
   - Open `STIP_compass_intro.R` in RStudio
   - The script will automatically install required packages using `pacman`
   - Run the entire script or execute sections step by step

3. **Required R Packages**
   The script will automatically install these packages:
   - `data.table`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `stringr`, `tidyr`, `DT`, `readr`

**Note**: The R version provides similar analysis to the Python Jupyter notebook but with R-specific data manipulation and visualization tools.
